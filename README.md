# Louis-Module-6-Server-Side-APIs
I was tasked with making a Weather Dashbaord using OpenWeather API. I'm shown the current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history when I search for a city.
I'm presented me with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed when I view future weather conditions for that city.
I'm presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
I'm again presented with current and future conditions for that city when I click on a city in the search history. Lastly I made sure the code was well commented and had no bugs.
